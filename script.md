**(0:00 - 2:00) Introduction & Hook**

"Good morning, everyone. Thank you for your time.

Right now, our website is a fantastic library of information. Customers can come, find rates, read about products... and then they leave. We operate like a library, waiting for them to check out a book. But what if we could be more like a concierge? Someone who anticipates their needs and guides them to the right solution at the perfect moment?

Today, I'm here to propose a fundamental shift in our digital strategy. We're going to move **from static pages to smart, proactive web engagement**. This isn't just about a new feature; it's about building an engine designed to drive **customer conversions** and deepen relationships."

***

**(Slide: #problem - The Current Reality)**

**(2:00 - 4:00) The Problem: Our "Leaky Bucket"**

"So, what's the problem we're trying to solve? I call it our 'Leaky Bucket.' Every visitor who leaves without taking action is a potential lost customer.

*[Note: Gesture towards the "The Path" and "The Problem" cards on the left.]*

The path is simple: users visit, they research, and they leave. The problem is that we are passively waiting for them to come back, losing a massive opportunity to engage them when their interest is at its absolute peak.

*[Note: Direct everyone's attention to the doughnut chart on the right.]*

This funnel chart visualizes the reality of that leaky bucket. We start with 100% of visitors, but by the time we get to a completed application, we're down to single digits. We're losing the vast majority along the way. Our goal is to plug these leaks by engaging users *inside* the funnel, not just hoping they make it to the end."

***

**(Slide: #importance - The Power of Peak Interest & #alignment - Strategic Alignment)**

**(4:00 - 7:00) The Philosophy & Strategic Imperative**

"To plug those leaks, we need to change our philosophy. In a world saturated with ads, attention is something we must *earn*, not demand. An immediate, aggressive pop-up is an interruption. It's annoying.

But a helpful tool that appears *after* a user has spent a few seconds reading a page? That’s perceived as guidance. It’s helpful.

*[Note: Point to the bar chart, #roiChart.]*

And the data backs this up. This chart shows the relative ROI. An immediate pop-up can actually perform worse than doing nothing because it annoys people. But a strategically timed, delayed widget can more than **double the return**. It’s the difference between being a pushy salesperson and a trusted advisor.

*[Note: Scroll down to the #alignment section.]*

This approach isn't just a marketing trick; it aligns perfectly with BMO's core strategic goals.
1.  **It Deepens Customer Relationships:** We become a helpful partner, not just a service provider.
2.  **It Accelerates Digital Sales:** We guide users from research directly to conversion.
3.  **And it Increases Market Share:** This is how we compete with agile FinTechs—by delivering a superior, smarter user experience."

***

**(Slide: #inspiration - Inspired From & #examples - Live Examples)**

**(7:00 - 10:00) The Proof: Industry Leaders are Doing This**

"This isn't a theoretical concept. The most successful digital players in finance and e-commerce are already using these strategies to win.

*[Note: Briefly gesture across the logos in the #inspiration section.]*

FinTechs like **Revolut** are masters of the timely promotional widget. Companies like **NerdWallet** have built their entire business on helpful comparison tools. Even major retailers like **Amazon** and **Wayfair** use urgency and abandoned cart recovery to drive billions in sales. They've proven the model works.

*[Note: Scroll to the #examples section.]*

And these are just a few live examples. I encourage you to visit sites like Axis Bank or Revolut later to see how seamlessly they integrate these tools into their user experience."

***

**(Slide: #solution - Let's Dive into our Solution)**

**(10:00 - 14:00) The Solution: Proof of Concept**

"So, let's move from theory to practice. What would this actually look like for us? I've put together a few functional Proofs of Concept.

*[Note: This is the most interactive part. Be ready to click and demonstrate.]*

First, I want you to see this in a real-world scenario. I’ve created two live demo pages.

*[Note: Click on the "Launch Live Demo 1 & 2" buttons.]*

The first link shows a page with a mortgage calculator—a persistent utility tool—and a promotional offer that slides in after a few seconds. The second shows another variation of an attention-grabbing widget. This simulates the exact user experience we're aiming for: providing value first, then presenting a relevant call to action.

Now, let's look at the individual components.

*[Note: Scroll down to the "GIC Rates Widget" and click the "View Current GIC Rates" button.]*

This is a **Utility Widget**. It's the hook. A customer researching investments gets immediate, tangible value. This builds trust and positions our products as the solution.

*[Note: Scroll to the "Promotional Widgets" section and click the "Trigger Promo Widget" button.]*

This is the **Promotional Widget**. It's the closer. After we've provided value, we can present a time-sensitive offer to create urgency and drive action.

*[Note: Scroll down to the "Interactive Tools" section and click "Show Interactive Tools".]*

Finally, here's a combined **Interactive Tool**. On the left, a savings calculator lets the user engage and see their own financial future. On the right, we provide clear, direct links to our credit card products. We're not just showing them an ad; we're helping them plan, and then showing them the tools to achieve that plan."

***

**(Slide: #journey - Two Paths to Conversion)**

**(14:00 - 16:00) The Vision: The New User Journey**

"These tools come together to create powerful new user journeys.

*[Note: Point to Journey 1.]*

Imagine this: A user lands on our mortgage page. A helpful calculator appears, they engage with it. As they scroll, a content card offers them a free guide. Finally, a promo widget gives them a limited-time rate. We've guided them from casual research to a confident application, all in one session.

*[Note: Point to Journey 2.]*

Or consider this: a user reads our blog, and before leaving, they allow notifications. A week later, when our savings rates go up, a notification appears right on their desktop. They click it, return to our site, and convert. We’ve just turned a lost visitor into a new customer, completely automatically."

***

**(Slide: #proposal - The Implementation Roadmap & #kpis - Measuring Success)**

**(16:00 - 19:00) The Plan: Our Roadmap & How We'll Measure It**

"So, how do we get there? We've designed a pragmatic, five-phase roadmap that minimizes risk and delivers value incrementally.

*[Note: Briefly summarize each phase.]*

* **Phase 1 & 2** are about building the **foundational promo and interactive tools**. We'll prove the concept and establish a baseline ROI.
* **For our tech managers**, **Phase 3** is key. We'll integrate everything into a central **Next.js component library managed by our CMS**. This makes the tools scalable, reusable, and empowers our marketing teams to deploy campaigns without needing engineering resources for every change.
* **For our product owners**, **Phase 4** is where it gets really smart. We'll build a relevance engine that **automatically matches offers to page content**, ensuring maximum relevance and conversion lift.
* And finally, in **Phase 5**, we implement **Web Push Notifications** to build that powerful re-engagement channel.

*[Note: Scroll to the #kpis section.]*

And we will measure everything. We'll track **Conversion Rate Lift**, **Engagement Rate**, reductions in **Campaign Deployment Time**, and the **Application Recovery Rate** from our push notifications. Every phase is tied to a clear business outcome."

**(Slide: #risks - Addressing Risks & #qa - Q&A)**

**(19:00 - 20:00) Conclusion & Discussion**

"We've also proactively identified the risks. Brand inconsistency? Our central component library solves that. A negative user experience? Our 'earn it' philosophy of timed, helpful engagement prevents it. Data security? All tools will be built in-house, with full security and backend collaboration.

By shifting from a passive library to an active, intelligent concierge, we can plug the leaks in our conversion funnel, build deeper relationships with our customers, and accelerate our 'Digital First' mission. We can stop waiting for customers to find their way and start guiding them.

Thank you. I'd now like to open it up for discussion and welcome your questions."


### QA
1.  **"What is the projected ROI on this initiative, and how long until we see a return?"**
    * **What they're really asking:** "Is this worth the investment of time and money?"
    * **Pro-Tip for Answering:** Be ready with numbers, even if they're based on the industry benchmarks you provided. For example: "Based on industry data showing an 8-10% lift in conversions, if we target the mortgage application funnel which generates $X million, a conservative 5% lift would translate to $Y in new business. We expect to see initial conversion data from Phase 1 within the first quarter of deployment."

2.  **"What is the total cost or team allocation required for all five phases?"**
    * **What they're really asking:** "How many developers and how much budget are you asking me to commit?"
    * **Pro-Tip for Answering:** Break it down. Focus on the cost for Phase 1 (the pilot) first, as it's a smaller, more digestible ask. "For Phase 1, we estimate needing one frontend developer and part-time support from a backend dev for 4-6 weeks. This allows us to prove the value and build a business case before committing to the full roadmap."

3.  **"How does this align with other major projects on our roadmap, like the mobile app redesign or the new AI chatbot initiative?"**
    * **What they're really asking:** "Why should I prioritize this over other important projects?"
    * **Pro-Tip for Answering:** Frame this as a complementary initiative, not a competing one. "That's a great question. This initiative is foundational. The reusable components we build here (Phase 3) can be leveraged by the chatbot team, and the user engagement principles can inform the mobile redesign. It enhances other projects by providing a scalable way to present targeted offers across all digital platforms."

4.  **"What is the single biggest risk, and what if this backfires and we just end up annoying our customers?"**
    * **What they're really asking:** "Have you thought about the downside?"
    * **Pro-Tip for Answering:** Acknowledge the risk directly and confidently state your mitigation from the #risks slide. "The biggest risk is negative user experience, which we’re addressing head-on. Our philosophy is 'earning attention, not demanding it.' Every widget will be A/B tested for timing and placement, and we'll be monitoring bounce rates and engagement KPIs obsessively to ensure we're being helpful, not intrusive."

---
1.  **"Which specific user journey or product page are we targeting for Phase 1?"**
    * **What they're really asking:** "What's the scope of the MVP and how did you decide?"
    * **Pro-Tip for Answering:** Be specific and justify your choice. "We propose starting with the 'High-Interest Savings Account' page. It has high traffic, a clear conversion goal, and the 'Savings Calculator' is a perfect utility widget to pilot. This gives us a clean, measurable test case."

2.  **"How will the marketing and content teams manage these widgets? Can a non-technical user in Contentful really create and place a new promo offer?"**
    * **What they're really asking:** "Is this actually going to make my marketing team's life easier, or will they still need a developer for everything?"
    * **Pro-Tip for Answering:** Reassure them by focusing on the goal of Phase 3. "Absolutely. The goal of Phase 3 is to fully empower them. We will build a 'Widget' component in Contentful where a content strategist can simply select the widget type from a dropdown (e.g., 'Promo', 'Calculator'), fill in fields for the headline and text, and add it to a page. No code required."

3.  **"You mentioned personalization. How deep does that go initially? Are we just targeting new vs. returning visitors, or can we target based on more specific user segments?"**
    * **What they're really asking:** "How sophisticated is this, and what's the plan for making it smarter over time?"
    * **Pro-Tip for Answering:** Show the crawl-walk-run approach. "In Phase 1, we'll start simple: new vs. returning, and maybe targeting based on the marketing campaign UTM tags in the URL. This proves the mechanics. As we move into Phase 4 and integrate with backend data, we can absolutely start targeting based on customer segments, products they already hold, or logged-in status."

4.  **"Which specific KPIs will we be tracking in our analytics platform (e.g., Adobe Analytics) to define success for the pilot?"**
    * **What they're really asking:** "How are we *actually* going to measure this?"
    * **Pro-Tip for Answering:** Get specific. "We'll set up dedicated tracking for: 1) Widget Impressions, 2) Widget Click-Through-Rate, and 3) Goal Conversion Lift. We’ll run an A/B test where 50% of users see the page with the widget and 50% see the control version, so we can isolate the direct impact on the 'Apply Now' button conversion rate."

---
1.  **"You mentioned a client-side 'relevance engine' in Phase 4. Won't that much JavaScript slow down the site and negatively impact our Core Web Vitals?"**
    * **What they're really asking:** "What is the performance cost of this feature?"
    * **Pro-Tip for Answering:** (This is your area of expertise!) Show you've considered performance from the start. "That's a critical point. The engine would be a lightweight script that executes *after* the main page content is loaded and interactive, so it won't impact LCP or FID. We'll use techniques like code-splitting and lazy-loading for the widget components themselves, ensuring they are only loaded when needed. We'll set a strict performance budget for any script we add."

2.  **"How do we plan to handle the backend infrastructure for the Web Push Notifications in Phase 5? What team needs to be involved?"**
    * **What they're really asking:** "What are the dependencies, and have you talked to those teams?"
    * **Pro-Tip for Answering:** Show you understand the cross-team collaboration required. "Phase 5 will require close partnership with the backend services team. We'll need them to build a secure endpoint that can trigger notifications. The frontend will manage the Service Worker for subscribing and receiving messages, but the business logic—like identifying an abandoned application—will live on the backend. We'd need to engage them early, likely during Phase 3, to get it on their roadmap."

3.  **"Regarding the CMS integration, how does the Next.js component library get updated data? For example, where do the GIC rates in the widget come from?"**
    * **What they're really asking:** "How does data flow in this architecture?"
    * **Pro-Tip for Answering:** Describe the data flow clearly. "The component's structure and static content will be managed in Contentful. For dynamic data like live GIC rates, the Next.js component will make a client-side API call to BMO's existing rates API. This ensures the data is always real-time without requiring a page rebuild, and it separates our content layer from our live data layer."

4.  **"What are the security implications of this? Especially with push notifications, how do we prevent misuse or ensure we aren't sending sensitive information?"**
    * **What they're really asking:** "Has this been vetted by security?"
    * **Pro-Tip for Answering:** Reassure them that security is paramount. "Security is a top priority. No personally identifiable information (PII) will ever be sent in the payload of a push notification. The message would be generic, like 'You have an update on your application.' When the user clicks, they are taken to our secure, authenticated portal to see the details. All development will go through the standard IT security review process before deployment."
