### **Presentation Script (Total Time: ~19 minutes)**

#### **Part 1: The Hook & The Core Problem (Time: 0:00 - 2:00)**

**(Have the Hero Section of your page visible on the main screen)**

"Good morning. In the next 20 minutes, Today, I want to talk about our biggest, quietest, and most expensive problem: missed opportunity.

Our website is fantastic. It's a wealth of information for our customers. But for the most part, it's a one-way conversation. We publish, they read, and then... they leave. We're waiting passively for them to decide to come back. We're putting the entire burden of action on them.

This is about flipping that model. It’s about shifting from a one way engagement into a **smart, proactive engine for customer conversion**."

**(Scroll down to the `#problem` section with the doughnut chart)**

"I call this our 'Leaky Bucket.' This chart visualizes the problem perfectly. For every 100 people who visit, we lose a huge number at each step. This isn't a failure; it's just the reality of a passive digital model.

The real issue is *when* we lose them: at their moment of **peak interest**. A customer on our mortgage article page will never be more engaged with that topic. By simply showing them rates and waiting, we are leaving a significant amount of potential revenue on the table."

#### **Part 2: The New Philosophy & Its ROI (Time: 2:00 - 4:00)**

**(Scroll down to the `#importance` section with the ROI chart)**

"So, how do we fix this without being annoying? Our new philosophy is simple: **we must earn our customer's attention, not demand it.**
So, how do we fix this without annoying our customers with immediate pop-ups? The philosophy is simple: we must earn their attention, not demand it.

An immediate, intrusive pop-up for offer is a nuisance. But a helpful tool that appears *after* a customer has been reading for a few seconds is perceived completely differently it's seen as helpful, timely guidance.

And the data is crystal clear on this. **[Point to the ROI chart on your screen]**. A strategically timed, helpful widget doesn't just work; it delivers a **2.5x greater return on investment** compared to doing nothing. This is the core of the strategy: be helpful, be timely, and convert."

#### **Part 3: Aligning With Our Core Mission (Time: 4:00 - 6:00)**

**(Scroll to the `#alignment` section)**

"Crucially, this isn't just a tech project; it's a direct enabler of our bank's core strategic goals.

1.  **It Deepens Customer Relationships:** By providing tools that help them plan and dream, we become a trusted partner, not just a service.
2.  **It Accelerates Digital Sales:** These widgets are designed to seamlessly guide users from research directly to conversion, boosting our online product adoption.
3.  **It Increases Market Share:** This allows us to compete head-to-head with the agile FinTechs on user experience, helping us win the next generation of digital-native customers.

This initiative is a strategic investment in our 'Digital First' future."

#### **Part 4: The 'Wow' Moment - The Live Demonstration (Time: 6:00 - 12:00)**

**(This is the centerpiece. Go slow and let the visuals sink in. Scroll to the `#solution` (POC) section.)**

"Now, let's move from theory to reality. I've built several functional Proofs of Concept to show you exactly what I mean.

First, the **Utility Widget**. A customer is on our GIC page, curious about the best rate they can get. Instead of making them search, let's give them the answer, right now."

**[CLICK the "View Current GIC Rates" button. The widget appears. PAUSE for 5-10 seconds.]**

"Instant value. Clear, simple, with a direct call to action. This is about building trust.

Next, a **Promotional Widget**. This is the kind of tool our competitors use every day to drive acquisitions."

**[CLICK the "Trigger Promo Widget" button. The blue offer card appears. PAUSE.]**

"Clean. Contextual. It creates urgency without being obnoxious.

But where this becomes truly powerful is with **Interactive Tools**."

**[CLICK the "Show Interactive Tools" button. The calculator and card links appear.]**

"Look at this savings calculator. This isn't just a form; it's a conversation starter. It helps a customer visualize their future. And right next to it, we provide the specific products to help them get there. We are connecting their goals directly to our solutions. This is how we become essential to our customers.

Finally, I've linked two live demos that bring this all together. I encourage you to explore these after the presentation to really get a feel for the seamless user experience we can create."

#### **Part 5: The Pragmatic Plan for Implementation (Time: 12:00 - 17:00)**

**(Scroll down to the `#proposal` (Roadmap) section.)**

"This vision is ambitious, but our plan to get there is pragmatic and phased. We don't have to boil the ocean.

**[Briefly touch on each phase, emphasizing the business value.]**

* **1st our Quick Win:** We build a reusable promo widget and deploy it on the homepage. This is low-hanging fruit to prove the ROI immediately.
* **then 2nd adds Value:** We deploy the interactive tools like the savings and mortgage calculators, increasing engagement and lead quality.
* **3rd enables Speed:** We integrate these tools into our CMS. This is critical—it empowers the marketing team to launch campaigns in hours, not weeks, without needing developers.
* **4th introduces Intelligence:** We build a smart engine that automatically matches the best offer to the right page, scaling personalization across the entire site.
* **And the end goal, is Recovery:** We implement Web Push Notifications to re-engage users who have left our site, recovering potentially lost leads.

Each is a logical step that builds on the last, de-risking the project and delivering value all along the way."

#### **Part 6: The Close - The Ask & Next Steps (Time: 17:00 - 19:00)**

**(Scroll to the final `#qa` section.)**

"We have a clear, data-backed strategy that aligns perfectly with our corporate goals. We have a phased, low-risk plan to execute it. And most importantly, we have a massive opportunity to stop leaving money on the table.

As we are at the end of the fiscal year, the timing is perfect to plan for a stronger, more proactive new year. It's a modest investment to build a foundational capability that will pay dividends for years to come.

Let's start plugging that leaky bucket.

Thank you. I'd now be happy to answer any questions you may have."
### QA
1.  **"What is the projected ROI on this initiative, and how long until we see a return?"**
    * **What they're really asking:** "Is this worth the investment of time and money?"
    * **Pro-Tip for Answering:** Be ready with numbers, even if they're based on the industry benchmarks you provided. For example: "Based on industry data showing an 8-10% lift in conversions, if we target the mortgage application funnel which generates $X million, a conservative 5% lift would translate to $Y in new business. We expect to see initial conversion data from Phase 1 within the first quarter of deployment."

2.  **"What is the total cost or team allocation required for all five phases?"**
    * **What they're really asking:** "How many developers and how much budget are you asking me to commit?"
    * **Pro-Tip for Answering:** Break it down. Focus on the cost for Phase 1 (the pilot) first, as it's a smaller, more digestible ask. "For Phase 1, we estimate needing one frontend developer and part-time support from a backend dev for 4-6 weeks. This allows us to prove the value and build a business case before committing to the full roadmap."

3.  **"How does this align with other major projects on our roadmap, like the mobile app redesign or the new AI chatbot initiative?"**
    * **What they're really asking:** "Why should I prioritize this over other important projects?"
    * **Pro-Tip for Answering:** Frame this as a complementary initiative, not a competing one. "That's a great question. This initiative is foundational. The reusable components we build here (Phase 3) can be leveraged by the chatbot team, and the user engagement principles can inform the mobile redesign. It enhances other projects by providing a scalable way to present targeted offers across all digital platforms."

4.  **"What is the single biggest risk, and what if this backfires and we just end up annoying our customers?"**
    * **What they're really asking:** "Have you thought about the downside?"
    * **Pro-Tip for Answering:** Acknowledge the risk directly and confidently state your mitigation from the #risks slide. "The biggest risk is negative user experience, which we’re addressing head-on. Our philosophy is 'earning attention, not demanding it.' Every widget will be A/B tested for timing and placement, and we'll be monitoring bounce rates and engagement KPIs obsessively to ensure we're being helpful, not intrusive."

---
1.  **"Which specific user journey or product page are we targeting for Phase 1?"**
    * **What they're really asking:** "What's the scope of the MVP and how did you decide?"
    * **Pro-Tip for Answering:** Be specific and justify your choice. "We propose starting with the 'High-Interest Savings Account' page. It has high traffic, a clear conversion goal, and the 'Savings Calculator' is a perfect utility widget to pilot. This gives us a clean, measurable test case."

2.  **"How will the marketing and content teams manage these widgets? Can a non-technical user in Contentful really create and place a new promo offer?"**
    * **What they're really asking:** "Is this actually going to make my marketing team's life easier, or will they still need a developer for everything?"
    * **Pro-Tip for Answering:** Reassure them by focusing on the goal of Phase 3. "Absolutely. The goal of Phase 3 is to fully empower them. We will build a 'Widget' component in Contentful where a content strategist can simply select the widget type from a dropdown (e.g., 'Promo', 'Calculator'), fill in fields for the headline and text, and add it to a page. No code required."

3.  **"You mentioned personalization. How deep does that go initially? Are we just targeting new vs. returning visitors, or can we target based on more specific user segments?"**
    * **What they're really asking:** "How sophisticated is this, and what's the plan for making it smarter over time?"
    * **Pro-Tip for Answering:** Show the crawl-walk-run approach. "In Phase 1, we'll start simple: new vs. returning, and maybe targeting based on the marketing campaign UTM tags in the URL. This proves the mechanics. As we move into Phase 4 and integrate with backend data, we can absolutely start targeting based on customer segments, products they already hold, or logged-in status."

4.  **"Which specific KPIs will we be tracking in our analytics platform (e.g., Adobe Analytics) to define success for the pilot?"**
    * **What they're really asking:** "How are we *actually* going to measure this?"
    * **Pro-Tip for Answering:** Get specific. "We'll set up dedicated tracking for: 1) Widget Impressions, 2) Widget Click-Through-Rate, and 3) Goal Conversion Lift. We’ll run an A/B test where 50% of users see the page with the widget and 50% see the control version, so we can isolate the direct impact on the 'Apply Now' button conversion rate."

---
1.  **"You mentioned a client-side 'relevance engine' in Phase 4. Won't that much JavaScript slow down the site and negatively impact our Core Web Vitals?"**
    * **What they're really asking:** "What is the performance cost of this feature?"
    * **Pro-Tip for Answering:** (This is your area of expertise!) Show you've considered performance from the start. "That's a critical point. The engine would be a lightweight script that executes *after* the main page content is loaded and interactive, so it won't impact LCP or FID. We'll use techniques like code-splitting and lazy-loading for the widget components themselves, ensuring they are only loaded when needed. We'll set a strict performance budget for any script we add."

2.  **"How do we plan to handle the backend infrastructure for the Web Push Notifications in Phase 5? What team needs to be involved?"**
    * **What they're really asking:** "What are the dependencies, and have you talked to those teams?"
    * **Pro-Tip for Answering:** Show you understand the cross-team collaboration required. "Phase 5 will require close partnership with the backend services team. We'll need them to build a secure endpoint that can trigger notifications. The frontend will manage the Service Worker for subscribing and receiving messages, but the business logic—like identifying an abandoned application—will live on the backend. We'd need to engage them early, likely during Phase 3, to get it on their roadmap."

3.  **"Regarding the CMS integration, how does the Next.js component library get updated data? For example, where do the GIC rates in the widget come from?"**
    * **What they're really asking:** "How does data flow in this architecture?"
    * **Pro-Tip for Answering:** Describe the data flow clearly. "The component's structure and static content will be managed in Contentful. For dynamic data like live GIC rates, the Next.js component will make a client-side API call to BMO's existing rates API. This ensures the data is always real-time without requiring a page rebuild, and it separates our content layer from our live data layer."

4.  **"What are the security implications of this? Especially with push notifications, how do we prevent misuse or ensure we aren't sending sensitive information?"**
    * **What they're really asking:** "Has this been vetted by security?"
    * **Pro-Tip for Answering:** Reassure them that security is paramount. "Security is a top priority. No personally identifiable information (PII) will ever be sent in the payload of a push notification. The message would be generic, like 'You have an update on your application.' When the user clicks, they are taken to our secure, authenticated portal to see the details. All development will go through the standard IT security review process before deployment."
