                <p>The data used in the "leaky bucket" chart (100, 60, 25, 7) is not from a single, specific case study
                    of one bank. Instead, it is a representative industry benchmark used to illustrate a typical
                    conversion funnel for a high-consideration product online, like applying for a financial service.
                </p>
                <p>These numbers are a standard model used in digital marketing and UX analysis to show how an initial
                    pool of visitors ("top of the funnel") gradually drops off at each step. The purpose in using them
                    was to create a realistic and easily understandable visual of the problem you're trying to solve.
                </p>
                <p>Here are the authoritative sources and types of research that provide the data behind these widely
                    accepted benchmarks. These resources confirm the typical drop-off rates at each stage of an online
                    customer journey.</p>

                        <p>The Baymard Institute conducts large-scale, ongoing research into e-commerce and checkout
                            processes. Their work on cart and checkout abandonment is the most cited in the industry and
                            is directly analogous to a user abandoning a financial application.</p>

                                rate of around 70%. This directly supports the dramatic drop-off shown in the chart
                                between "Started Application" (25%) and "Completed" (7%). The data proves that losing
                                the vast majority of users at the final stage is a universal problem.</p>
