                <p>The data used in the "leaky bucket" chart (100, 60, 25, 7) is a representative industry benchmark,
                    not from a single case study. It illustrates a typical conversion funnel for high-consideration
                    products online (e.g., financial services). This standard model in digital marketing shows how an
                    initial pool of visitors gradually drops off at each step.</p>

                                    consistently shows that interrupting a user the moment they arrive on a page
                                    increases frustration and bounce rates. This "pattern interrupt" is perceived as an
                                    advertisement, creating a negative brand impression and often leading to a lower
                                    conversion rate than doing nothing at all.</p>

                                <p><span class="font-semibold">Rationale:</span> This demonstrates the core principle of
                                    "earning attention." By delaying the widget's appearance by 5-7 seconds, we allow
                                    the user to orient themselves and show initial interest in the content. The widget
                                    is then perceived not as an interruption, but as a helpful, contextual guide. CRO
                                    case studies consistently show that this timed, value-driven approach dramatically
                                    increases positive interactions and conversions, leading to a significantly higher
                                    return on investment.</p>
